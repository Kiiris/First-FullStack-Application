# Recipe Website 
## ***Description***
Perhaps similar in functionality but a completely different user experience will be to create an application for looking a cooking recipes. I wanted to create another repeatable useful experience for a user that will allow them to make use of data from an api and be able to log the recipes they use, ones they like, and create ones of their own! This particular fullstack application will be a cooking recipe guide and one which allows users to post recipes themselves. Details below.

### ***Goals and Potential Ideas ***

***
This will be a applciation where a user will be prompted to create a profile. If they login with their correct username and password they will be able to customize their profile with a name, description and photo. There will be a nav bar that directs the user to several different routes/pages with different functions. In one page, the user will be able to view a list of foods that they can click on to see a detailed recipe of how to make it. In another, they will be able to view a list of user create recipes that are of another kind of API and schema that I set up and if they are logged in do a put request that creates another recipe on the page. Users may go to ANY recipe and be able to click on it and write a score on it and they will also be able to save them to their profile as notable recipes they might want to review later. 

*Objectives:*

- [] ERD Diagram for list of organizational hierchy of project
- [] Functional Nav bar that alternates between seperate routes/pages
- [] Utulizes API and maps a list of foods for the user to interact with 
- [] Login and profile information that is stored in backend mongoose databse for the specific user
- [] Another database for user recipes that is mapped onto one page, and on another a form to fill out a put request to make new recipes
- [] Professional styling, onClick and hover effects and neatly centered component
- [] A way to score/review recipes that users interact with that is stored in a users profile (like a watch list)
- [] [Potentially] a feature in the users profile that allows them to write and track progress on the site, and things they've cooked over a period of time
